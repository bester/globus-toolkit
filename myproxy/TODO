TODO list for myproxy:

 * myproxy-server daemon still spits messages to stdout/stderr. 
	(hope that's fixed)

 * Add a MYPROXY_SERVER environment variable for myproxy-init 
	(done; also did the same for myproxy-get-delegation and myproxy-destroy)

 * myproxy-get-delegation not handling bad pass phrase
	(that should be fixed now)

 * delegation lifetime fubar
	(proposed fix has been implemented)


 * myproxy-get-delegation should move delegated proxy to better named place

 * add MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT, MYPROXY_SERVER_MAX_CRED_HOURS, MYPROXY_SERVER_MAX_DELEG_HOURS to configuration file
