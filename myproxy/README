1. Overview
-----------

Myproxy provides a server with client-side utilities to store and
retrieve delegated X509 credentials via the Grid Security
Infrastructure (GSI).  The myproxy-init program delegates a proxy
credential to the myproxy-server, which stores the proxy to disk.  The
myproxy-get-delegation program retrieves stored proxy credentials from
the myproxy-server.  The myproxy-destroy program removes credentials
stored on a myproxy-server.

The myproxy-init, myproxy-get-delegation, and myproxy-destroy programs
always verify the identity of the myproxy-server using the GSI before
proceeding.  By default, the myproxy-server is expected to have a
distinguished name of the form "host/<fqhn>".  Set the
MYPROXY_SERVER_DN environment variable to override this.

Proxy credentials are stored unencrypted by the myproxy-server.  It
should be run on a well-secured host.  The myproxy-server verifies
that clients are authorized to store, retrieve, and remove credentials
using GSI and passphrase authentication, according to rules defined in
the server configuration file.

2. Target Usage Scenarios
------------------

The myproxy server can support three different credential retrieval
scenarios.  The default myproxy server configuration file supports
only the first scenario.  Myproxy administrators should consider the
security implications of each scenario and decide which scenarios to
support in their server.

In the first scenario, a user gives the myproxy passphrase for a
stored credential to a trusted service, such as a web portal.  Then,
that service authenticates to the myproxy server with its service
credential and the user's passphrase to retrieve a proxy credential
for the user.  The trusted service must match one of the
authorized_retrievers lines in the myproxy server configuration file.

In the second scenario, a user retrieves a previously stored
credential from the myproxy server, authenticating with the passphrase
previously associated with the credential.  The user authenticates to
the myproxy server with an "anonymous" X.509 identity, since he or she
doesn't have an X.509 credential to start with.  The myproxy server
configuration file must allow "anonymous" as a valid
authorized_retriever to support this.

In the third scenario, a user delegates a proxy credential to a
trusted service, such as a batch scheduler, and that service uses
myproxy to renew the user's proxy credential as needed (for example,
until the user's jobs complete).  The service authenticates to the
myproxy server with its service credential and then performs a second
authentication using the user's proxy credential to retrieve a new
proxy credential for the user.
