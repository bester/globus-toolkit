1. Overview
-----------

Myproxy v0.2 provides a  server and  client-side utilities to store
and retrieve  delegated  X509  certificates  via the  Globus  Security
Infrastructure (GSI). Services that do not  support GSI, including web
browsers,  can retrieve user  credentials from a  myproxy-server via a
user generated passphrase.

The myproxy-server uses the GSI to perform mutual authentication
between clients and web portals. It should be installed on a secured
host separate from the web server. The myproxy-server saves the
credentials in the case the system should go down. A configuration
file is used to store information about which portals and users can
access the myproxy-server.

The user uses myproxy-init to delegate credentials to myproxy-server,
along with a username and pass phrase to authenticate credential 
retrieval from a web server.

Then at a later time when the user connects to the web portal they
provide the username and pass phrase to the portal. The portal then
runs myproxy-get-delegation, providing the username and pass phrase.
myproxy-server authenticates the portal and verifies the user
information. Assuming this all checks out, it delegates another copy
of the users credentials to the portal for use.

The user may destroy their credentials stored with myproxy-server
at any time using myproxy-destroy.

Myproxy v0.2 has protocol differences from Myproxy v0.1 and is not
compatible with v0.1 in any way.

The file PROTOCOL contains a description of the current myproxy
protocol.
