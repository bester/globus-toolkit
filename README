1. Overview
-----------

This is Myproxy v0.1b1. It's intended used is to act as a delegation
channel between users and services that don't support the Globus
delegation mechanism, mainly web browsers and web servers or portals.

Myproxy works by have a server, myproxy-server, that runs on a secured
host, probably not the web server but a secured machine specifically
set up for the task.

The user uses myproxy-init to delegate credentials to myproxy-server,
along with a username and pass phrase to authenticate retrieval.

Then at a later time when the user connects to the web portal they
provide the username and pass phrase to the portal. The portal then
runs myproxy-get-delegation, providing the username and pass phrase.
myproxy-server authenticates the portal and verifies the user
information. Assuming this all checks out, it delegates another copy
of the users credentials to the portal for use.

The user may destroy their credentials stored with myproxy-server
at any time using myproxy-destroy.

All of the myproxy programs support the -usage argument to provide
information about their execution options.
