/**
 *  @page drivers Globus XIO Drivers
 *
 *  Globus XIO introduces a notion of a driver stack to its API.
 *  With in globus_xio every IO operation must occur on a globus_xio 
 *  handle.  Associated with each handle is a stack of drivers.
 *  A driver is a module piece of code that implements the globus_xio
 *  driver interface.  The purpose of a driver is manipulate data passed
 *  in by the user in someway.  Each driver in a stack will serve its own 
 *  unique purpose.
 *
 *  IO operations pass from driver to driver, starting at the top of the 
 *  stack and ending at the bottom.  When the bottom layer driver finishes 
 *  with the operation it signals globus_xio that it has completed.  
 *  Completion notification then follows the driver stack up to the top.
 *
 *  There are two types of drivers:
 *
 *  Transport driver:
 *     A transport driver is one that is responsible for actually putting
 *     bytes onto the wire.  For example: A TCP driver or a UDP driver would
 *     be an example of transport drivers.  
 *
 *     Per driver stack there must be exactly one transport driver and
 *     must be at the bottom of the stack.  A transform driver is defined
 *     by its lack of passing an operation to the next driver in the stack.
 *     This type of driver does not rely on globus_xio for further completion
 *     of an operation, rather it is self sufficent in this task.
 *
 *  Transform driver:
 *     A tranform driver is any intermediate driver in the stack.  These 
 *     drivers are indentified by there reliance on the driver stack to
 *     complete the operation.  These drivers must pass the operation
 *     down the stack because they cannot complete it themselves.  An
 *     example of a transform driver would be a gsi driver.  This driver
 *     would wrap and unwrap messages, but would not be able to complete
 *     the transport itself, so it would rely on the remaining drivers in
 *     the stack.

/**
 *  @page driver_api Globus XIO Driver API
 * 
 *  The globus xio driver api is a set of functions and interfaces
 *  to allow a developer to create a backend driver for globus_xio.
 *  To create a driver the user must implement all of the interface
 *  functions in the driver specification.
 *  There are also a set of functions provide to assist the driver
 *  author in implemention.
 *
 *  Quick Start:
 *    For basic driver needs the user will have to pay attention to a
 *    few new structures and concepts.
 *
 *    globus_xio_operation_t
 *        This structure represents a request for an operation.  If
 *        the driver can service the operation it does so and the
 *        calls the appropriate finish_operation() function.  If the
 *        driver cannot completely service the operation it can pass()
 *        it along to the next driver in the stack.  As soon as the
 *        operation structure is either finished or passed it is no 
 *        longer valid for use in any other function.
 *
 *    globus_xio_driver_context_t
 *        A context represents a open handle to the driver stack for xio.
 *        The driver obtains a context by calling globus_xio_driver_open().
 *        When the open operation completes (it callback is called) the 
 *        driver then has a context.  The context allows the user to do some
 *        complex things that will be described later.
 *
 *    globus_xio_stack_t
 *        This structure provides the driver with information about the
 *        driver stack  It is mainly used for creating context as a
 *        parameter to lobus_xio_driver_open()..
 * 
 *  Here is a typcial sequence of events for a globus_xio transform
 *  driver:
 *
 *        Open
 *           globus_xio_driver_open_t is called.  The user calls
 *           globus_xio_driver_open() passing it the operation and 
 *           the stack and a callback.  When the open callback is called 
 *           the driver is given a new operation as a parameter.  The driver
 *           will then call globus_xio_driver_finished_open() passing
 *           it the now initialized context and the newly received
 *           operation.
 *           The call to globus_xio_driver_finished_open() does two things:
 *           1) it tells globus_xio that this driver has finished its open
 *           operation, and 2) it gives xio the context (which contains
 *           information on the drivers below it).
 *
 *        Read/Write
 *            The read or write interface funcion is called.  It receives
 *            a operation as a parameter.  The driver then calls the 
 *            approriate pass operation and waits for the callback.  When
 *            the callback is received the driver calls finished_operation
 *            passing in the operation structure it received in the callback
 *
 *        Close
 *            The close interface function is called and is passed an
 *            operation and a context.  The driver will call 
 *            globus_xio_driver_close() passing it the operation.
 *            When the close callback is received the driver calls
 *            globus_xio_driver_finished_close() passing it the
 *            operation received in the close callback and the context
 *            received in the interface function.  At this point the context
 *            is no longer valid..

/**
 *   @page adv_drivers Globus XIO advanced driver programming
 *
 *   The typical driver implementatin is describe above.  However globus_xio
 *   allows driver authors to do more advanced things.  Some of these things
 *   will be explored here.
 *
 *   Read Ahead
 *
 *   Once a context is open a driver can spawn operation structures from
 *   it.  This gives the driver the ability to request io from the driver
 *   stack before it receives a call to its own interface io interface
 *   function.  So if a driver wishes to read ahead it does the following:
 *   1) it creats an operation by calling globus_xio_driver_create_operation()
 *   and passing it the context it is intereesting in using.
 *   2) call globus_xio_driver_read() using this operations.  When the read
 *   callback is received the driver may call finished_operation() on the
 *   op it receives (this ultimitely results in very little, since this 
 *   operation was started by this driver, but it is good practice and will
 *   free up resources that would otherwise leak).
 *   3) Now when the user finally does receive a read interface call from
 *   globus_xio it can imediately finish it using the operation it just
 *   received as a parameter and updating the iovec structure to represent 
 *   the read that already occured.
 *
 *    <explain finished from previous>
 * 
 *
 *   Preopening handles.
 *   
 *   Once the driver has received a globus_xio_driver_stack_t it can 
 *   open a context.  The globus_xio_driver_stack_t comes in the
 *   call to the interface function globus_xio_server/client_init_t().
 *   The driver uses this structure in a call to globus_xio_driver_open().
 *   When this functionality completes the driver has an initialized 
 *   context and can use it to create operations as described above.
 *   The driver can now hang onto this context until it receives an open
 *   interface function call.  At which time it can call 
 *   globus_xio_driver_finished_open() passing in the conext and thereby
 *   glueing the pre opened context with the requested globus_xio operation.

 *********************************************************************/
/**
 *  @page dd_driver Data descriptors
 *
 *  globus_xio uses data descriptors to associate meta data with the 
 *  data being writen or the data read.
 *
 *  Data descriptors flow into the drivers read and write interface
 *  functions by way of the operation structure.  If the driver is
 *  interested in viewing the data decriptor it can request it from
 *  the operation structure via a call to 
 *  globus_xio_driver_operation_get_data_descriptor() and it can view
 *  any driver specific data descriptor via a call to
 *  globus_xio_driver_data_descriptor_get_specific().  The driver
 *  can modify values in the data descriptor by setting values before
 *  passing the request down the stack.  Several functions are available
 *  to modify the data descriptors.  There is no need to "set()" the 
 *  data descriptors back into the operation.  The functions for manipluating
 *  the values in a DD affect the values xio has directly.
 *
 *  Data descriptors flow back to the driver in the callbacks for
 *  the data operations.  When calling finished operation on a data 
 *  operation the driver must pass in a data descriptor.  It should get 
 *  this data descriptor from the io operation callback.
 *
 *  Life Cycle:
 *
 *  Passing in a data descriptor:
 *    A data descriptor is first created by the globus_xio user.  The user 
 *    can add driver specific data descriptors to it.  Once the usre has
 *    created and set the attributes on its data descriptor to their liking
 *    they pass it into a globus_xio data operation (either read or write).
 *    When the data descriptor is passed on globus_xio will make an internal
 *    copy of it.  It does this by first coping the user the level
 *    data descriptor and then walkinging through the list of driver specific
 *    data descriptor contianed in to and requesting the the driver make 
 *    a copy of the driver specific data descriptor.  If ever a driver
 *    specific data descriptor is NULL globus_xio need not call into its
 *    drivers dd_copy function.  If ever the user level data descriptor is
 *    NULL globus_xio need not deal with the data descriptor functionality at 
 *    all.  
 *
 *  A data descriptor coming back up the stack
 *    Once an io operation reachs the transport driver (the bottom of the
 *    stack) it takes on a slightly different role.  On the way in it
 *    is describing what is requested to be done with the data, on the way
 *    out it is describing what has actually been done.  Once the transport
 *    driver performs the operation it should adjust the data descriptor
 *    to reflect what has actually happened (few drivers will need to worry
 *    about this).  Each driver on the way up can adjust the data 
 *    descriptor and its driver specific data decriptor.  When xio reachs the
 *    the top of the stack it calls a user callback.  When that callback 
 *    returns all memory associated with the data descriptor is cleaned up.
 *    The interface function globus_xio_driver_data_descriptor_free() is
 *    used for this.
