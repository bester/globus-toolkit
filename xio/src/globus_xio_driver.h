/**
 *  @defgroup globus_xio_driver Globus XIO Driver
 *
 *  Globus XIO introduces a notion of a driver stack to its API.
 *  With in globus_xio every IO operation must occur on a globus_xio 
 *  handle.  Associated with each handle is a stack of drivers.
 *  A driver is a module piece of code that implements the globus_xio
 *  driver interface.  The purpose of a driver is manipulate data passed
 *  in by the user in someway.  Each driver in a stack will serve its own 
 *  unique purpose.
 *  \n
 *  IO operations pass from driver to driver, starting at the top of the 
 *  stack and ending at the bottom.  When the bottom layer driver finishes 
 *  with the operation it signals globus_xio that it has completed.  
 *  Completion notification then follows the driver stack up to the top.
 *
 *  \par Driver Types:
 * 
 *  \par
 *     <tt>Transport driver:</tt>\n
 *     A transport driver is one that is responsible for actually putting
 *     bytes onto the wire.  For example: A TCP driver or a UDP driver would
 *     be an example of transport drivers.  
 *     \n\n
 *     Per driver stack there must be exactly one transport driver and
 *     must be at the bottom of the stack.  A transform driver is defined
 *     by its lack of passing an operation to the next driver in the stack.
 *     This type of driver does not rely on globus_xio for further completion
 *     of an operation, rather it is self sufficent in this task.
 *
 *  \par 
 *     <tt>Transform driver:</tt>\n
 *     A tranform driver is any intermediate driver in the stack.  These 
 *     drivers are indentified by there reliance on the driver stack to
 *     complete the operation.  These drivers must pass the operation
 *     down the stack because they cannot complete it themselves.  An
 *     example of a transform driver would be a gsi driver.  This driver
 *     would wrap and unwrap messages, but would not be able to complete
 *     the transport itself, so it would rely on the remaining drivers in
 *     the stack.
 *

 *  The globus xio driver api is a set of functions and interfaces
 *  to allow a developer to create a backend driver for globus_xio.
 *  To create a driver the user must implement all of the interface
 *  functions in the driver specification.
 *  There are also a set of functions provide to assist the driver
 *  author in implemention.
 *
 *  \par 
 *    <tt>Quick Start:</tt>\n
 *    Four basic driver needs the user will have to pay attention to a
 *    few new structures and concepts.
 *
 *    \par 
*         <tt>globus_xio_operation_t</tt>\n
 *        This structure represents a request for an operation.  If
 *        the driver can service the operation it does so and the
 *        calls the appropriate finish_operation() function.  If the
 *        driver cannot completely service the operation it can pass()
 *        it along to the next driver in the stack.  As soon as the
 *        operation structure is either finished or passed it is no 
 *        longer valid for use in any other function.
 *
 *    \par 
 *      <tt>globus_xio_driver_handle_t</tt>\n
 *        A driver_handle represents a open handle to the driver stack for xio.
 *        The driver obtains a driver_handle by calling 
 *        globus_xio_driver_open().
 *        When the open operation completes (it callback is called) the 
 *        driver then has a driver_hadnle.  The driver_handle 
 *        allows the user to do some
 *        complex things that will be described later.
 *
 *    \par 
 *      <tt>globus_xio_stack_t</tt>\n
 *        This structure provides the driver with information about the
 *        driver stack  It is mainly used for creating driver_handle as a
 *        parameter to lobus_xio_driver_open()..
 * 
 *  \par Typical Sequence:
 *  Here is a typcial sequence of events for a globus_xio transform
 *  driver:
 *
 *        \par 
 *          <tt>Open</tt>\n
 *           globus_xio_driver_open_t is called.  The user calls
 *           globus_xio_driver_open() passing it the operation and 
 *           the stack and a callback.  When the open callback is called 
 *           the driver is given a new operation as a parameter.  The driver
 *           will then call globus_xio_driver_finished_open() passing
 *           it the now initialized driver_handle and the newly received
 *           operation.
 *           The call to globus_xio_driver_finished_open() does two things:
 *           1) it tells globus_xio that this driver has finished its open
 *           operation, and 2) it gives xio the driver_handle (which contains
 *           information on the drivers below it).
 *
 *        \par 
 *          <tt>Read/Write</tt>\n
 *            The read or write interface funcion is called.  It receives
 *            a operation as a parameter.  The driver then calls the 
 *            approriate pass operation and waits for the callback.  When
 *            the callback is received the driver calls finished_operation
 *            passing in the operation structure it received in the callback
 *
 *        \par 
 *            <tt>Close</tt>\n
 *            The close interface function is called and is passed an
 *            operation and a driver_handle.  The driver will call 
 *            globus_xio_driver_close() passing it the operation.
 *            When the close callback is received the driver calls
 *            globus_xio_driver_finished_close() passing it the
 *            operation received in the close callback and the driver_handle
 *            received in the interface function.  At this point the 
 *            driver_handle
 *            is no longer valid..
 */
/**
 *   @addtogroup globus_xio_driver
 *
 *   \par Advanced Driver Programming
 *   The typical driver implementatin is describe above.  However globus_xio
 *   allows driver authors to do more advanced things.  Some of these things
 *   will be explored here.
 *
 *   \par 
 *   <tt>Read Ahead</tt>\n
 *   Once a driver_handle is open a driver can spawn operation structures from
 *   it.  This gives the driver the ability to request io from the driver
 *   stack before it receives a call to its own interface io interface
 *   function.  So if a driver wishes to read ahead it does the following:
 *
 *   \li it creats an operation by calling globus_xio_driver_create_operation()
 *   and passing it the driver_handle it is intereesting in using.
 *
 *   \li call globus_xio_driver_read() using this operations.  When the read
 *   callback is received the driver may call finished_operation() on the
 *   op it receives (this ultimitely results in very little, since this 
 *   operation was started by this driver, but it is good practice and will
 *   free up resources that would otherwise leak).
 *
 *   \li Now when the user finally does receive a read interface call from
 *   globus_xio it can imediately finish it using the operation it just
 *   received as a parameter and updating the iovec structure to represent 
 *   the read that already occured.
 *
 *   \par 
 *   <tt>Preopening handles.</tt>\n
 *   Once the driver has received a globus_xio_driver_stack_t it can 
 *   open a driver_handle.  The globus_xio_driver_stack_t comes in the
 *   call to the interface function globus_xio_server/client_init_t().
 *   The driver uses this structure in a call to globus_xio_driver_open().
 *   When this functionality completes the driver has an initialized 
 *   driver_handle and can use it to create operations as described above.
 *   The driver can now hang onto this driver_handle until it receives an open
 *   interface function call.  At which time it can call 
 *   globus_xio_driver_finished_open() passing in the driver_handle and thereby
 *   glueing the pre opened driver_handle with the requested globus_xio 
 *   operation.

 *                     data descriptors
 *********************************************************************/
/**
 *  @page dd_driver Data descriptors
 *
 *  globus_xio uses data descriptors to associate meta data with the 
 *  data being writen or the data read.
 *
 *  Data descriptors flow into the drivers read and write interface
 *  functions by way of the operation structure.  If the driver is
 *  interested in viewing the data decriptor it can request it from
 *  the operation structure via a call to 
 *  globus_xio_driver_operation_get_data_descriptor() and it can view
 *  any driver specific data descriptor via a call to
 *  globus_xio_driver_data_descriptor_get_specific().  The driver
 *  can modify values in the data descriptor by setting values before
 *  passing the request down the stack.  Several functions are available
 *  to modify the data descriptors.  There is no need to "set()" the 
 *  data descriptors back into the operation.  The functions for manipluating
 *  the values in a DD affect the values xio has directly.
 *
 *  Data descriptors flow back to the driver in the callbacks for
 *  the data operations.  When calling finished operation on a data 
 *  operation the driver must pass in a data descriptor.  It should get 
 *  this data descriptor from the io operation callback.
 *
 *  Life Cycle:
 *
 *  Passing in a data descriptor:
 *    A data descriptor is first created by the globus_xio user.  The user 
 *    can add driver specific data descriptors to it.  Once the usre has
 *    created and set the attributes on its data descriptor to their liking
 *    they pass it into a globus_xio data operation (either read or write).
 *    When the data descriptor is passed on globus_xio will make an internal
 *    copy of it.  It does this by first coping the user the level
 *    data descriptor and then walkinging through the list of driver specific
 *    data descriptor contianed in to and requesting the the driver make 
 *    a copy of the driver specific data descriptor.  If ever a driver
 *    specific data descriptor is NULL globus_xio need not call into its
 *    drivers dd_copy function.  If ever the user level data descriptor is
 *    NULL globus_xio need not deal with the data descriptor functionality at 
 *    all.  
 *
 *  A data descriptor coming back up the stack
 *    Once an io operation reachs the transport driver (the bottom of the
 *    stack) it takes on a slightly different role.  On the way in it
 *    is describing what is requested to be done with the data, on the way
 *    out it is describing what has actually been done.  Once the transport
 *    driver performs the operation it should adjust the data descriptor
 *    to reflect what has actually happened (few drivers will need to worry
 *    about this).  Each driver on the way up can adjust the data 
 *    descriptor and its driver specific data decriptor.  When xio reachs the
 *    the top of the stack it calls a user callback.  When that callback 
 *    returns all memory associated with the data descriptor is cleaned up.
 *    The interface function globus_xio_driver_data_descriptor_free() is
 *    used for this.
