.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
program generates X\&.509 proxy certificates derived from the currently available certificate files\&. By default, this command generates a
\m[blue]\fBRFC 3820\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
Proxy Certificate with a 512 bit key valid for 12 hours in a file named
/tmp/x509up_u\fIUID\fR\&. Command\-line options and variables can modify the format, strength, lifetime, and location of the generated proxy certificate\&.
.PP
X\&.509 proxy certificates are short\-lived certificates, signed usually by a user\'s identity certificate or another proxy certificate\&. The key associated with a proxy certificate is unencrypted, so applications can authenticate using a proxy identity without providing a passphrase\&.
.PP
Proxy certificates provide a convenient alternative to constantly entering passwords, but are also less secure than the user\'s normal security credential\&. Therefore, they should always be user\-readable only (this is enforced by the GSI libraries), and should be deleted after they are no longer needed\&.
.PP
This version of
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
supports three different proxy formats: the old proxy format used in early releases of the Globus Toolkit up to version 2\&.4\&.x, an IETF draft version of X\&.509 Proxy Certificate profile used in Globus Toolkit 3\&.0\&.x and 3\&.2\&.x, and the RFC 3820 profile used in Globus Toolkit Version 4\&.0\&.x and 4\&.2\&.x\&. By default, this version of
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
creates an RFC 3820 compliant proxy\&. To create a proxy compatible with older versions of the Globus Toolkit, use the
\fB\-old\fR
or
\fB\-draft\fR
command\-line options\&.
.PP
The full set of command\-line options to
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
are:
.PP
\fB\-help\fR, \fB\-usage\fR
.RS 4
Display the command\-line options to
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR\&.

.RS 4
Display the version number of the
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
command
.RE
.PP
\fB\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Display information about the path to the certificate and key used to generate the proxy certificate, the path to the trusted certificate directory, and verbose error messages
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR
.RS 4
Suppress all output from
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
except for passphrase prompts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-verify\fR
.RS 4
Perform certificate chain validity checks on the generated proxy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-valid \fR\fB\fIHOURS\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIMINUTES\fR\fR, \fB\-hours \fR\fB\fIHOURS\fR\fR
.RS 4
Create a certificate that is valid for
\fIHOURS\fR
hours and
\fIMINUTES\fR
minutes\&. If not specified, the default of twelve hours and no minutes is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-cert \fR\fB\fICERTFILE\fR\fR, \fB\-key \fR\fB\fIKEYFILE\fR\fR
.RS 4
Create a proxy certificate signed by the certificate located in
CERTFILE
using the key located in
KEYFILE\&. If not specified the default certificate and key will be used\&. This overrides the values of environment variables described below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-certdir \fR\fB\fICERTDIR\fR\fR
.RS 4
Search
\fICERTDIR\fR
for trusted certificates if verifying the proxy certificate\&. If not specified, the default trusted certificate search path is used\&. This overrides the value of the
\fBX509_CERT_DIR\fR
environment variable
.RE
.PP
\fB\-out \fR\fB\fIPROXYPATH\fR\fR
.RS 4
Write the generated proxy certificate file to
\fIPROXYPATH\fR
instead of the default path of
/tmp/x509up_u\fIUID\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-bits \fR\fB\fIBITS\fR\fR
.RS 4
When creating the proxy certificate, use a
\fIBITS\fR
bit key instead of the default 512 bit keys\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-policy \fR\fB\fIPOLICYFILE\fR\fR
.RS 4
Add the certificate policy data described in
\fIPOLICYFILE\fR
as the ProxyCertInfo X\&.509 extension to the generated proxy certificate\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-pl \fR\fB\fIPOLICY\-OID\fR\fR, \fB\-policy\-language \fR\fB\fIPOLICY\-OID\fR\fR
.RS 4
Set the policy language identifier of the policy data specified by the
\fB\-policy\fR
command\-line option to the oid specified by the
\fIPOLICY\-OID\fR
string\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-path\-length \fR\fB\fIMAXIMUM\fR\fR
.RS 4
Set the maximum length of the chain of proxies that can be created by the generated proxy to
\fIMAXIMUM\fR\&. If not set, the default of an unlimited proxy chain length is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-pwstdin\fR
.RS 4
Read the private key\'s passphrase from stdin instead of reading input from the controlling tty\&. This is useful when scripting
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-limited\fR
.RS 4
Create a limited proxy\&. Limited proxies are generally refused by process\-creating services, but may be used to authorize with other services\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-independent\fR
.RS 4
Create an independent proxy\&. An independent proxy is not treated as an impersonation proxy but as a separate identity for authorization purposes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-draft\fR
.RS 4
Create a IETF draft proxy instead of the default RFC 3280\-compliant proxy\&. This type of proxy uses a non\-standard proxy policy identifier\&. This might be useful for authenticating with older versions of the Globus Toolkit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-old\fR
.RS 4
Create a legacy proxy instead of the default RFC 3280\-compliant proxy\&. This type of proxy uses a non\-standard method of indicating that the certificate is a proxy and whether it is limited\&. This might be useful for authenticating with older versions of the Globus Toolkit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-rfc\fR
.RS 4
Create an RFC 3820\-compliant proxy certificate\&. This is the default for this version of
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To create a proxy with the default lifetime and format, run the
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
program with no arguments\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
% \fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=example/CN=Joe User
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:

Your proxy is valid until: Thu Mar 18 03:48:05 2010
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To create a stronger proxy that lasts for only 8 hours, use the
\fB\-hours\fR

\fB\-bits\fR
command\-line options to
\fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
% \fBgrid\-proxy\-init\fR \fB\-hours 8\fR \fB\-bits 1024\fR
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=example/CN=Joe User
