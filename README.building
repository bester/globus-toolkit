First, you need to install GPT and the Globus Toolkit packages
required for MyProxy.  Right now the best way to do that is to run

  $ ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --with-buildopts="-verbose"
  $ make gsi-myproxy install 

in the gt-all-source-installer directory.  That will include all the
Globus Toolkit packages needed by MyProxy.

Alternatively, you can use a GT binary installer, in which case
you'll additionally need to install globus_core with the following
command (replacing gcc32dbg with the flavor of your choice):

  $ gpt-build -nosrc gcc32dbg

You'll need GSI user credentials to run the MyProxy clients and host
credentials to run the myproxy-server.

Second, you need special versions of the GNU autotools for working
with GPT:

  $ cvs -d \
    :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages \
    co autotools
  $ cd autotools
  $ ./install-autotools $GLOBUS_LOCATION

This will install special versions of autoheader, automake, autoconf,
etc., into $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin.  These special autotools must be in
your $PATH when you run the commands below.

To build in a CVS workspace (replacing gcc32dbg with the flavor of
your Globus Toolkit installation):
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --with-flavor=gcc32dbg
$ make

Don't use threaded (thr) flavors.

To install from a CVS workspace to $GLOBUS_LOCATION:
$ make install

To build source packages from a CVS workspace:
$ make dist

---------- Releasing MyProxy ----------

0. Make sure all changes for the release are documented in the VERSION
   file.  Be sure to note any API changes.

1. Update the version definitions in a few different files.  Be aware
   of the difference between the MyProxy version and the GPT package
   version.

     myproxy.h: update the MYPROXY_VERSION_* constants
     VERSION: update version on first line and add entry to Version History
     pkgdata/pkg_data_src.gpt.in: update Aging_Version and VersionLabel
     myproxy.spec: update the Version line

   Commit your changes to CVS.

2. Make sure you're using the special autotools in $GLOBUS_LOCATION:

    $ which autoconf
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/autoconf

3. Build a source package.

     $ ./bootstrap
     $ ./configure --with-flavor=gcc32dbg
     $ make dist

4. Verify that the source package builds against supported versions of
   the Globus Toolkit.  It should build without warnings.

     $ gpt-build -force -verbose myproxy-*.tar.gz gcc32dbg

   For instructions on submitting test builds to the UW NMI system,
   see nmi/README.  The results of all test builds, including
   automated nightly builds, can be viewed at:

   http://nmi-web.cs.wisc.edu/nmi/index.php?page=results%2Foverview&opt_project=MyProxy

5. Test the installation.  (-valgrind will work only on x86.)

     $ grid-proxy-init
     $ myproxy-test -startserver -valgrind

6. Tag CVS with the version number (ex. MYPROXY_3_3).

     $ cvs tag MYPROXY_X_X

7. Sign the release file with GPG.

     $ gpg -ab myproxy-*.tar.gz

8. Upload the release notes and myproxy-*.tar.gz* files to
   <https://sourceforge.net/projects/cilogon/files/myproxy/>.

   Just for backup, also upload to myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu:

    $ scp README LICENSE VERSION myproxy-*.tar.gz* \
      osage.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/afs/ncsa/web/grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htdocs/myproxy/dl

9. Update MyProxy web site in
   /afs/ncsa.uiuc.edu/web/grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htdocs/myproxy.

   Perform a CVS update to update to the latest changes in CVS. Then,

     download.html: add new entry at top of table for new release
     index.html/news.html/news.xml: add note to News
     install.html: any changes to install instructions needed?
     man: update html man pages

   To update html man pages, run make_html in the man subdirectory of
   your CVS workspace and copy the resulting html files to the web
   site.

   Commit web site changes to CVS.

10. Send release announcement to myproxy-announce@globus.org.
    Sign it with 'gpg --clearsign'.

11. Add MyProxy version number at
    <https://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/editversions.cgi?product=MyProxy>.

12. Add release announcement on www.cilogon.org.
