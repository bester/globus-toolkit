Credential Data File Format
===========================

Every credential stored on the myproxy server has a credential file 
(with .creds extension) and a data file (with .data extension). The 
credential file stores the proxy while the data file stores other
information about the credential.

The credential filename has the format 
<username>-<credname>.creds

and the data filename has the format
<username>-<credname>.data

The format of a data file is as follows :

OWNER=<owner name>
PASSPHRASE=<passphrase>
LIFETIME=<credential lifetime>

The data file may also contain the following optional fields :

NAME=<credential name>
DESCRIPTION=<credential description>
RETRIEVERS=<retriever regex>
RENEWERS=<renewer regex>

Every data file ends with END_OPTIONS field that marks the end of the
data file.
