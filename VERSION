This is myproxy v0.5.1 12 Feb 2003
This version should be compatible with all versions since v0.2.

Version History
---------------
v0.5.1 12 Feb 2003 (GPT package version 1.3)
  This release fixes a bug where the X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY
  environment variables would confuse myproxy-init.

v0.5.0 15 Nov 2002 (GPT package version 1.2)
  This is the first version for Globus Toolkit 2.2.  It adds support
  for storing multiple credentials per username, stores private keys
  encrypted with the credential's passphrase (if set), and adds the
  myproxy-change-pass-phrase command.  It is also the first version to
  be released unter the NCSA Open Source license.

v0.4.6 3 Sep 2002 (GPT package version 1.1)
  This version adds sample init.d and xinetd entries in the GPT
  package.

v0.4.5 28 Aug 2002 (GPT package version 1.0)
  This is the first version packaged with GPT.  In addition to changes
  for GPT compatibility, it contains minor changes to some MyProxy
  debug messages.

v0.4.4 22 Mar 2002
  This version adds the myproxy-info command.

v0.4.3 6 Mar 2002
  This version adds support for per-credential authorization.  Users
  can specify retrieval/renewal policies for a credential on upload
  using myproxy-init.

v0.4.2 4 Feb 2002
  This version includes the GSI distinguished name matching logic that
  was removed in v0.4.0, so for example host/fqhn will now match fqhn
  again.  It also adds support for restricting the TCP port ranges of
  the clients.

v0.4.1 4 Dec 2001
  This version adds support for Globus 2.0 and optionally using the
  distinguished name from the proxy certificate as the default myproxy
  username.

v0.4.0 20 Nov 2001
  This version adds support for anonymous X.509 client authentication,
  to allow users to retrieve a credential using their myproxy
  passphrase when they don't already have a credential.  The myproxy
  server configuration file can enable or disable anonymous and
  certificate-based (from v0.3) authentication.

v0.3 5 Oct 2001
  This version adds support for certificate-based authentication in
  addition to passphrase based authentication, to enable credential
  renewal.  It was developed by Daniel Kouril and Miroslav Ruda for
  the European DataGrid project.

v0.2alpha3 11 Oct 2000
  This version has seen wide use with Grid Portals and is probably the
  most stable and widely tested version of myproxy to date.
