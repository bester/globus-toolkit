This is MyProxy v3.5 XX Xxx 2006.
This version should be protocol compatible with all versions since v0.2.
Binary compatibility of the C API is not guaranteed between releases.

Version History
---------------
v3.5 XX Xxx 2006
  - dropped support for certificate_issuer option in

v0.6.5 8 Apr 2005 (GPT package version 1.17)
  - added support for RFC 3820 proxy certificate format
  - renamed myproxy-get-delegation to myproxy-logon;
    kept myproxy-get-delegation symlink for backward compatibility
  - added myproxy-store and myproxy-retrieve commands for storing and

    note myproxy-retrieve support must be explicitly enabled by
    setting authorized_key_retrievers in myproxy-server.config

v0.6.4 4 Jan 2005 (GPT package version 1.16)
  - fixed file permission bug in myproxy-admin-load-credential

v0.6.3 22 Nov 2004 (GPT package version 1.15)
  - updated GPT packaging for compatibility with GT 3.9.3
    (globus_gssapi_gsi-4.0)
  - added support for $GT_PROXY_MODE="old" in myproxy-get-delegation,
    to retrieve a "legacy globus proxy" from an end-entity certificate
    stored in the MyProxy repository.
  - modified client tools to attempt connecting to the server first,
    before prompting for user input, to catch server problems early.
  - added initial experimental support for Kerberos authentication via
    the SASL/GSSAPI mechanism.
  - removed dependency on perl Expect package in myproxy-test
  - added myproxy-test -startserver option
  - added myproxy-server --pidfile option to ease myproxy-server
    shutdown

v0.6.2 21 Jun 2004 (GPT package version 1.14)
  - added initial experimental support for PAM authentication via
    the SASL/PLAIN mechanism.
  - changed myproxy-admin-change-pass so an empty pass phrase
    can be used for unencrypted keys (for example, for renewal keys)
  - fixed myproxy-admin-adduser to not depend on nonexistent
    myproxy-admin-adduser-config command
  - removed pass phrase functions from myproxy-admin-load-credential,
    so the existing pass phrase on the source key is kept as is.
    Use myproxy-admin-change-pass to change the pass phrase of a
    credential after loading.
  - fixed GT 2.2 and Java CoG incompatibility introduced in v0.6.1.
    Note: if repository contains end-entity credentials, Java CoG
    will retrieve old-style (legacy) proxies because the Java CoG
    certificate request doesn't specify the proxy type.
  - changed signature of myproxy_get_delegation() method.
    original signature is restored in v2.0.

v0.6.1 30 Mar 2004 (GPT package version 1.13)
  Fixed a bug where the myproxy-server would always delegate new-style
  proxy credentials from end-entity credentials in repository.  The
  myproxy-server now respects proxy type in the certificate request
  when end-entity credentials are stored in repository.  However, if
  the repository contains proxy credentials, the server will delegate
  a proxy of the same type as stored in the repository irrespective of
  the certificate request, because new-style and old-style proxies
  can't be mixed.  This bug fix resulted in an incompatibility with GT
  2.2 and Java CoG clients, fixed in v0.6.2.

v0.6.0 22 Mar 2004 (GPT package version 1.12)
  - added max_proxy_lifetime server configuration option for limiting
    the lifetime of retrieved credentials

v0.5.9 28 Jan 2004 (GPT package version 1.11)
  - removed requirement for /dev/urandom and instead let OpenSSL seed
    its random number generator itself using its standard methods
  - added myproxy-admin-change-pass command
  - changed myproxy-get-delegation -d option to have effect even when
    -a option is not given
  - added support for OpenSSL 0.9.7

v0.5.8 23 Sep 2003 (GPT package version 1.10)
  - fixed networking problem with v0.5.7 on some platforms

v0.5.7 25 Aug 2003 (GPT package version 1.9)
  - fixed additional problems with handling large credentials
  - bugfix: myproxy-admin-load-credential fails to prompt for
    passphrase of source credential in versions 0.5.4-0.5.6.

v0.5.6 31 Jul 2003 (GPT package version 1.8)
  - added support for Globus Toolkit 3.0 libraries
  - added support for new GSI proxy certificate format
  - fixed 'myproxy-info -d'
  - fixed credential problem when using Globus Toolkit 2.4 libraries
  - removed buffer length restriction in credential renewal protocol

v0.5.5 30 May 2003 (GPT package version 1.7)
  - added support for Globus Toolkit 2.4 libraries
  - added support for external passphrase quality enforcement with
    passphrase_policy_program command in myproxy-server.config

  This version fixes a build problem on AIX.

v0.5.2 10 Mar 2003 (GPT package version 1.4)
  This version adds the myproxy-admin-query and
  myproxy-admin-load-credential commands and adds support for running
  the myproxy-server with a /CN=myproxy/fqhn credential.

v0.5.1 12 Feb 2003 (GPT package version 1.3)
  This release fixes a bug where the X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY
  environment variables would confuse myproxy-init.

v0.5.0 15 Nov 2002 (GPT package version 1.2)
  This is the first version for Globus Toolkit 2.2.  It adds support
  for storing multiple credentials per username, stores private keys
  encrypted with the credential's passphrase (if set), and adds the
  myproxy-change-pass-phrase command.  It is also the first version to
  be released unter the NCSA Open Source license.  Note that due to
  version incompatibilities with Globus Toolkit 2.2 libraries and the
  Java CoG (not specific to MyProxy), this and future versions of
  MyProxy are not compatible with Java CoG versions before 1.0.

v0.4.6 3 Sep 2002 (GPT package version 1.1)
  This version adds sample init.d and xinetd entries in the GPT
  package.

v0.4.5 28 Aug 2002 (GPT package version 1.0)

  can specify retrieval/renewal policies for a credential on upload
  using myproxy-init.

v0.4.2 4 Feb 2002
  This version includes the GSI distinguished name matching logic that
  was removed in v0.4.0, so for example host/fqhn will now match fqhn
  again.  It also adds support for restricting the TCP port ranges of
  the clients.

v0.4.1 4 Dec 2001
  This version adds support for Globus 2.0 and optionally using the
  distinguished name from the proxy certificate as the default myproxy
  username.

v0.4.0 20 Nov 2001
  This version adds support for anonymous X.509 client authentication,
  to allow users to retrieve a credential using their myproxy
  passphrase when they don't already have a credential.  The myproxy
  server configuration file can enable or disable anonymous and
  certificate-based (from v0.3) authentication.

v0.3 5 Oct 2001
  This version adds support for certificate-based authentication in
  addition to passphrase based authentication, to enable credential
  renewal.  It was developed by Daniel Kouril and Miroslav Ruda for
  the European DataGrid project.
