MUST HAVE
--------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER:
-instrument logging in server
-implement abort_cb on server side
-verify data destroy working on server end (and no leaks!)
-call control_disconnected() when needed
-server mem management... i know there are some leaks with attrs and now with instance for event stuff
-mimic wu cmdline opt names when applicable i.e. -S -p etc etc (important now so people don't start using opts that we will drop)
-verify inetd is prepped right
-return from event cb immediately

LIB:
-verify feat list
-decide if locking in event cb is right api decision

BOTH:
-add proper return vals/messages for error situations
-verify reply codes
-recheck exit/quit/abort states (after server abort/exit stuff is good)

--------------------------------------------------------------

OTHER: (non-code)
merge with trunk (i assume 3.3. will be cut from trunk)
update gridftp-server-stable-branch tag
verify shit still works after that!




if time, desire, etc etc:
--------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER:
-make forking/daemon mode better (maybe leave this out for now)
-define logging classes in config
-implement setuid/setgid to anonymous_user
-produce netlogger output (based on event timer i guess?... -Z option in wu)
-global config opts can be non-overridable, or forced to a range
-think about config val checking/verification
-sync(2) before each transfer stat update (by option only, unless it doesn't affect perf)
-make sure server will work with tcpd

LIB:
-additional functionality for STAT (959 says transfer stats and other shit)
-additional command to get server version

--------------------------------------------------------------















(old shit that was already here)
partial
-- add offset to tranfer func callout

test
--crazy messages sent to server

errors
-- create error codes for user
-- check proper replys etc
