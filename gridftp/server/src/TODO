This is the current list of things outstanding for the 4.0 release.

protocol:
-- verify FEAT response
-- reply codes - verify.
-- notify server of error when cred problem in gssapi_ftp driver

striping:
-- verify eofc handling, see if we can move out of dsi into data.c
-- optimize _get_read_range()
-- consolidate some restart ranges instead of sending one from every stripe
-- need some spec compliant support for partitioned layout
    current stripeblocksize impl is basically spec compliant RR

logging:
-- instrument code
-- clean up transfer and usage logging

other:
-- error out of option parsing properly
-- int->void*->int casting over ipc... better way?

cleanup:
-- verify test suite
-- find leaks in error cases
-- DOC

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
known issues:
-- ipc failure while the handle is owned by the dsi destroys the handle. should
    not free until user calls release or close, and just error out of any other
    calls that attempt to use the handle. (verify fixed?)
-- there may be an issue with group permissions -- not sure if it results
    in any problems.

** NOTE **
-- passing size_t's over ipc as ints... will be a problem on 64 bit systems 
    where int isn't big enough.  not likely to be a problem in practice
    since the args we store in size_t (buffer sizes, etc) should never be
    too large for an int...
JB: i think this is ok.  size_ts are being sent as uint32 but they are
    safely being converted to UInt32s first.  There is a certainly a
    potiential for overflow, however i think the size_ts we are sending
    should not exceed 4GB.


future:
-- alternate ipc connection modes
-- ipc local mode
-- specify log format by configuration
-- write out pidfile in daemon mode
