This XIO based GridFTP driver is a client for the GridFTP server. This provides
a posix-like IO interface to access the GridFTP server. It is built on top of 
the globus ftp client library.

Features supported:
# Partial file transfer (While reading a file from the server, user can do 
  'seek' using handle_cntl and while writing a file to the server, user can 
  specify the offset as a data descriptor. It should be noted that 'seek' is 
  not allowed if there is an IO pending) 
# Parallel TCP streams (In order delivery is not guaranteed. Ordering driver 
  should be used on top of this if in order delivery is desired)
# Connection caching (User is allowed to provide a ftp_client_handle. In this 
  case, user is responsible for closing the ftp_client_handle)
# Option (through attribute control) to associate each read/write with a partial  file transfer. This option is to allow the user to use the ftp client handle 
  he gives to the driver because this gives him a guarantee that if he is not 
  explicitly reading or writing, the driver is not using the handle.
# User is allowed to register multiple reads or multiple writes. Simultaneous 
  read and write operation is not allowed but read and write can be intermixed 
  ie. all reads must complete before doing a write and all writes must complete 
  before doing a read.
# User is allowed to cancel any operation.

Limitations:
# It enforces a waitfor of 1 for read operations.
# It always write the full buffer regardless of the write waitfor. 
# It will only read into the first iovec. 
# It does not support third party transfers.
