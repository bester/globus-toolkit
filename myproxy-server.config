#
# Complete Sample Policy
#
# The following lines define a sample policy that enables all
# myproxy-server features.  See below for more examples.
accepted_credentials  "*"
authorized_retrievers "*"
default_retrievers    "*"
authorized_renewers   "*"
default_renewers      "none"
authorized_key_retrievers "*"
default_key_retrievers "*"

#
# Accepted Credentials
#
# Which credentials is the server willing to accept and store?
#
# Example: Willing to store Alliance credentials
#accepted_credentials  "/C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=*"
#
# Example: Willing to store Globus credentials
#accepted_credentials  "/C=US/O=Globus/*"
#accepted_credentials  "/O=Grid/O=Globus/*"
#
# Example: Willing to story any credentials
#accepted_credentials  "*"


#
# Authorized Retrievers
#
# Who is authorized to retrieve credentials from the repository?
#
# Example: Allow only trusted Alliance web portals with a valid
# Myproxy passphrase to retrieve credentials, thereby discouraging
# users from giving out their Myproxy passphrase to untrusted sites
# and limiting the vulnerability of the credentials stored on the
# Myproxy server.
# Note: NCSA doesn't audit sites with portal certificates.
#authorized_retrievers "/C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=portal/*"
#
# Example: Allow any client, including anonymous clients, with a valid
# MyProxy passphrase to retrieve credentials.  This is the recommended
# setting, as it gives users the flexibility to set their own policies
# on their credentials.
#authorized_retrievers "*"

#
# Default Retrievers
#
# If a user doesn't set a retrieval policy with the credential on
# upload, apply the following policy in addition to the
# authorized_retrievers policy.
#
# If no default_retrievers policy is set, then only the
# authorized_retrievers policy is applied.
#
# Example: Allow NCSA portals to retrieve credentials by default.
#default_retrievers "/C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=portal/*"

#
# Authorized Renewers
#
# Who is authorized to renew a proxy credential before it expires?
#
# If no authorized_renewers line is defined, credential renewal is not
# allowed. 
#
# Example: Allow trusted schedulers to renew proxy credentials for the
# jobs they manage.
# Note: NCSA doesn't give out /CN=scheduler/* certificates.  This is
# a fictitious example.
#authorized_renewers "/C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=scheduler/*"
#
# Example: Allow any client to renew a proxy credential.  In this
# case, the client can simply authenticate with the proxy it wants to
# renew.  This is potentially dangerous, in that it can be used to
# extend the lifetime of a compromised proxy credential on any host.
# However, when use with default_renewers, it gives users the
# flexibility to set their own policies.
#authorized_renewers "*"

#
# Default Renewers
#
# If a user doesn't set a renewal policy with the credential on
# upload, apply the following policy.
#
# Example: Disable renewal unless the client specifically authorizes it.
#default_renewers "none"
#
# Example: Allow the Condor-G scheduler on modi4.ncsa.uiuc.edu to
# renew user credentials by default.
#default_renewers "/C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=condorg/modi4.ncsa.uiuc.edu"

#
# Passphrase Policy Enforcement
#
# Specifies the path to an external passphrase policy enforcement
# program.  The program is passed the new passphrase via stdin and is
# passed the following arguments: username, distinguished name,
# credential name (if any), per-credential retriever policy (if any),
# and per-credential renewal policy (if any).  If the passphrase is
# acceptable, the program should exit with status 0.  Otherwise, it
# should exit with non-zero status, causing the operation in progress
# (credential load, passphrase change) to fail with the error message
# provided by the program's stdout.
#
#passphrase_policy_program /usr/local/sbin/myproxy-passphrase-policy

#
# Authorized Retrievers of end-entity keys
#
# Who is authorized to retrieve end-entity credentials from the repository?
#
# Example: Allow only trusted Alliance web portals with a valid
# Myproxy passphrase to retrieve credentials, thereby discouraging
# users from giving out their Myproxy passphrase to untrusted sites
# and limiting the vulnerability of the credentials stored on the
# Myproxy server.
# Note: NCSA doesn't audit sites with portal certificates.
#authorized_key_retrievers "/C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=portal/*"
#
# Example: Allow any client, including anonymous clients, with a valid
# MyProxy passphrase to retrieve credentials.  This is the recommended
# setting, as it gives users the flexibility to set their own policies
# on their credentials.
#authorized_key_retrievers "*"

#
# Default Retrievers of end-entity keys
#
# Who is authorized to retrieve end-entity credentials from the repository?
#
# If a user doesn't set a retrieval policy with the credential on
# upload, apply the following policy in addition to the
# authorized_retrievers policy.
#
# If no default_retrievers policy is set, then only the
# authorized_retrievers policy is applied.
#
# Example: Allow NCSA portals to retrieve credentials by default.
