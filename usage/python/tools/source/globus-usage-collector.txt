NAME
----
globus-usage-collector - Record usage statistics packets

SYNOPSIS
--------
globus-usage-collector [-h] [-p 'PORT'] [-b] -f 'FILE'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *globus-usage-collector* command is a service which accepts usage packets
on a UDP port and writes them to a file for later processing.

The full set of command-line options to *globus-usage-collector* consists of:

-h::
    Display a help message and exit

-p 'PORT'::
    Listen on UDP port 'PORT' instead of the default port `4810`.

-d 'DIRECTORY'::
    Write data to 'DIRECTORY' instead of the configured path.

-b::
    Run the *globus-usage-collector* process in the background

-f 'FILE'::
    Write the process ID of the backgrounded *globus-usage-collector* process
    to 'FILE'.

FILES
-----

The files are written in a subdirectory of the current directory
with its name derived from the current time in UTC. The form of this
directory name is 'YYYYMMDD', (e.g. the date July 20,
2009 would be `20090720`). Within that directory, 
files are generated with name based on the hour (again in UTC). The form of
the filename is 'HH.gup' .when the packet
was processed. That is, a packet processed at 3:20 a.m. on that same day would
be stored in the file `20090720/03.gup`.


Each usage packet file consists of simple records containing the binary UDP
usage packet data. Each packet record consists of 4 fields:

|==============================================================================
| Address Length (2 bytes)  | Big-endian length of the Address
| Address                   | Big-endian packed binary address
| Packet Length (2 bytes)   | Big-endian length of the packet
| Packet                    | Binary packet data
|==============================================================================
