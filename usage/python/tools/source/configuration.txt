=== Configuring Usage Stats Tools ===

The globus usage stats tools package configuration is specified in
'$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-usage-tools.conf'. 
This file is normally created automatically by the setup package
*globus_usage_tools_setup*, but this document
describes the syntax and attributes of the file.

==== Configuration Syntax ====

The configuration file is parsed by the python language, so the normal python
language rules apply. Each attribute must begin at the start of the line with
no leading whitespace. Each value must be a string value delimited by quote
characters (").


==== Configuration Attributes ====

The configuration attributes understood by the tools consist of:
    
driver::
    Database driver package name. This driver must be compliant with Python
    Database API Specification v2.0 (PEP 249). The
    *globus_usage_tools* package has been tested with
    the *psycopg2* database driver only.


database::
    Database name. This database must be initialized with the database schema
    from the *globus_usage_tools* package. The default database name is
    'usagestats'.

host::
    Database server host. If empty, the driver-specific default will be used.

port::
    Database server port. If empty, the driver-specific default will be
    used.

user::
    Database user (if needed) to authenticate with the database. This user must
    have permissions to select and insert on the database. If empty, the
    driver-specific default will be used.

password::
    Database user password (if needed) to authenticate with the database.

data_directory::
    Path to store usage packet data files. The default from the setup package
    is '$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/usage/'.

collector_port::
    UDP port number to listen to for usage packets. The default from the setup
    package is `4810`.
