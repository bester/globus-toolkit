.Introduction

This guide contains configuration information for system
administrators working with the Globus Usage Statistics Tools. It
provides references to information on procedures typically performed by
system administrators, including installation, configuring, deploying,
and testing the installation. It also describes additional
prerequisites and host
settings necessary for Usage Statistics Tools operation.

=== Building and Installing ===

==== Preparation and Prerequisites ====

The Usage Statistics Tools are written in python, with the
following prerequisites:

- http://www.python.org[Python 2.5.x, 2.6.x, or 2.7.x]
- http://initd.org/psycopg/[psycopg2] python postgres module

The *globus-usage-tools* package will
also require a postgres database server to be running. This
may be running on another machine than the collector and
uploader processes.


To install these prerequisites on debian linux, install the
packages *python*, *python-psycopg2* using *apt-get*:
            
----
# apt-get install python python-psycopg2
----


To install these prerequisites on Fedora linux, install the
packages *python*, and *python-psycopg2* using *yum*:

----
# yum install python python-psycopg2
----

For other systems, consult your operating system's documentation
for package names, or install from the sources mentioned above.

==== Downloading and Installing the Usage Statistics Tools ====

Download the source as a tarball, or download source or binary RPM
package. These are available at 
http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/usagestats/0.10


To build the RPM:

----
# rpmbuild -bb globus-usage-tools-0.10-1.src.rpm
----


To install a binary package, use the command

----
# yum localinstall globus-usage-tools-0.10-1.noarch.rpm
----


To build the source tarball:

----
# python setup.py install \
    --root PREFIX \
    --install-scripts PREFIX/sbin
----

==== Configuring the Usage Stats Tools ====

include::configuration.txt[]

===== Database configuration =====

First, create a database user and database to contain the usage stats
data. This and the following sections assume that the usagestats
database and the service will be run on the same machine. If that is
not the case, run the database configuration commands on the machine
running the database, and use that machine's hostname in place of
`localhost` in the uploader configuration below.


.Debian-specific configuration

----
# su postgres
postgres% createuser --pwprompt usagestats
Enter password for the new role:
Enter it again:
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n)  n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n)  n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more roles? (y/n)  n
% createdb -O usagestats usagestats
% psql -h localhost --password -U usagestats usagestats \
        < /usr/share/globus-usage-tools/usage-tables.sql
% psql -h localhost --password -U usagestats usagestats \
        < /usr/share/globus-usage-tools/usage-aggregation-tables.sql
% psql -h localhost --password -U usagestats usagestats \
        < /usr/share/globus-usage-tools/usage-views.sql
----

.Fedora-specific configuration

On fedora, you'll need to configure the postgres service to allow
password authentication, unless you will
be running the *globus-usage-uploader* as the
`usagestats` user. To do this, change the method
used for IPv4 local connections in
`/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` from `ident` to `md5`.

---- 
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                               ident
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all         ::1/128               ident
----


Then, create the user and database:

----
# su postgres
postgres% createuser --pwprompt usagestats
Enter password for the new role:
Enter it again:
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n)  n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n)  n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more roles? (y/n)  n
postgres% createdb -O usagestats usagestats
postgres% psql -h localhost --password -U usagestats usagestats \
    < /usr/share/globus-usage-tools/usage-tables.sql
postgres% psql -h localhost --password -U usagestats usagestats \
    < /usr/share/globus-usage-tools/usage-aggregation-tables.sql
postgres% psql -h localhost --password -U usagestats usagestats \
    < /usr/share/globus-usage-tools/usage-views.sql
----


[[usagestats-configuration]]
==== Usage Statistics Tools Uploader Configuration ====

The usage stats package looks up the database connection
information and database password the file
`/etc/globus-usage-tools.conf`.
The file contains one variable definition per line, with the value
contained within quotation marks. Add the password value into the line
`password = ""` between the quotation marks.



==== Running the Usage Stats Tools ====

The usage stats tools consist of two programs: *globus-usage-collector*, and
*globus-usage-uploader*. The *globus-usage-collector* program acts as a network
service to receive usage stats packets and store them to the filesystem. The
*globus-usage-uploader* parses those packet files and uploads their contents
into a PostgreSQL database.
    

The *globus-usage-collector* program stores the packets it receives to files
named by the pattern /var/lib/globus/usage/'YYYYMMDDHH'.gup,
where 'YYYYMMDD' is the date that the packet was
received and 'HH' is the hour in which it was
received. The *globus-usage-collector* program is typically run indefinitely in
the background. Full usage information is available in the
link:#usagestats-reference[reference] section of this manual.

The packages contain an System-V style init script to run the
collector. To start it on a  debian system, use the command

----
# invoke-rc.d globus-usage-collector start
----


To start it on a fedora system, use the command

----
# service globus-usage-collector start
----

To enable it to start automatically, use the debian command

----
# update-rc.d globus-usage-collector enable
----

To enable it to start automatically, use the fedora commands

----
# chkconfig --add globus-usage-collector enable
# chkconfig globus-usage-collector on
----

The *globus-usage-uploader* program parses packet files
created by *globus-usage-collector* and loads them
into the database. The database contact information is stored in the
configuration file referred to in the
link:#usagestats-configuration[configuration section] of
this document. The *globus-usage-uploader* processes
all files that were created before the current hour in the 
/var/lib/globus/usage/'YYYYMMDD' directories and
then exits. It is meant to be run periodically by a service such as *cron*.

[NOTE]
If the *globus-usage-uploader* program is not run periodically, the
*globus-usage-collector* program may fail if it reaches disk or directory
limits.

An example crontab is included in the file
`/usr/share/doc/globus-usage-tools/examples/usagestats.cron`.
